# Building a simple convolutional neural network with Python

This is my first neural network - built with Python, Scipy and Numpy.

## Goals
- Build a simple neural network that can classify handwritten letters
- Learn how neural networks work und understand the math behind them
- Improve Python skills
- Have fun playing around

## Specification
1. Da
2.
